## Task 2: Customer Retention Dashboard

### Overview
This task involves creating a Power BI dashboard to visualize key performance indicators (KPIs) and insights related to customer retention in the telecom industry. The goal is to define meaningful KPIs, analyze customer demographics, and present actionable insights to the telecom Retention Manager and the PwC engagement partner.

### Objectives

#### What You'll Learn
1. How to define key performance indicators (KPIs) related to customer retention.
2. How to create a dashboard that visualizes customer demographics and insights.

#### What You'll Do
1. Define proper KPIs to evaluate and predict customer retention.
2. Create a Power BI dashboard using the provided dataset to reflect customer demographics and retention-related insights.
3. Write a concise email summarizing the findings and proposing actionable changes based on the analysis.

### Background Information
The retention department of the telecom company seeks to:
- Retain hard-earned customers and reduce churn.
- Transition from a reactive approach (contacting customers post-termination) to a proactive strategy (predicting at-risk customers in advance).
- Gain deeper insights into customer behavior using advanced data visualization.

The Retention Manager and the engagement partner from PwC require a self-explanatory dashboard to:
- Understand key customer demographics and retention trends.
- Make data-driven decisions to improve customer retention strategies.

#### Key Points from the Retention Manager:
1. Customers in the telecom industry are valuable, and retaining them is crucial.
2. Current efforts are reactive, targeting customers after contract termination.
3. Predicting at-risk customers beforehand is a priority.
4. Previous customer analyses using Excel have been insufficient.
5. Visualizing data clearly is essential for communicating insights to management.

### Deliverables

### Defined KPIs
Possible KPIs for customer retention include:
- Customer churn rate.
- Percentage of customers at risk of churn.
- Customer demographics (age, gender, location, etc.).
- Average revenue per user (ARPU).
- Customer satisfaction score (if available).
